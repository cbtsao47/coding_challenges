# Async JS

---

Asynchronicity is the backbone of modern web dev in JS yet...
JS is:

- single threaded ( one command runs at a time)
- synchronously executed ( each line is run in order the code appears)

Core JS engine has 3 parts:

- call stack
- thread of execution
- memory/variable enironment

Web Browser (Web API)

- Dev tools
- console (console.log etc)
- sockets
- network requests (XHR,fetch)
- HTML DOM (DOM)
- timer (setTimeOut)
- localStorage

Promises

- object
- {value : ...
  onFullfilled:[]
  }
